1.
invaders[invaderRow][invaderRow] = new Warrior(); 
on line 249 should be
invaders[invaderRow][invaderCol] = new Warrior();
This creates a segfault error because invaders have more columns than rows and so the program will eventually attempt to write
outside of the appropriately allocated memory space.

2.
On line 27, there is an obstructing semicolon that prevents the code from running properly. 
The second if statement on line 32 should be an else if to avoid some edge cases.
